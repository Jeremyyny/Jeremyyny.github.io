I am a final year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu/). My advisor is [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon). 

**Research:** I am broadly interested in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Currently, I spend the majority of my time working on the theory and practice of generative models, as well as their interactions with representation learning, weakly supervised learning, AI alignment, inverse problem solving, signal processing, and decision making under uncertainty. I am one of the early contributors to [score-based generative models](blog/2021/score) (or diffusion models), a new family of generative techniques with flexible model architectures, stable training algorithms, high-quality sample generation, superior model likelihood, and principled controllable synthesis. I like to tackle fundamental problems that are broadly significant, devise methods that are simple yet effective, and aim to build intelligent systems that can widely benefit humanity.

**Previously:** I was a research intern at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/), Uber ATG, and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), where I worked with [Jun Zhu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml), [Raquel Urtasun](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/), and [Richard Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php).

**Career Update:** I will be joining the Department of Electrical Engineering and Department of Computing + Mathematical Sciences at California Institute of Technology as an Assistant Professor starting from January 2024. I am looking for self-motivated Ph.D. students and postdocs to join my group in Fall 2023. If you are interested in working with me as a Ph.D. student, please apply to Caltech CMS, EE, or CNS and mention my name in your applications. If you are interested in a postdoc position, please contact me directly.
