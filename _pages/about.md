**Research:** My research is in machine learning, with a particular focus on developing scalable ways to model, estimate, analyze and generate high-dimensional data with complex structures. Typical topics of interest include, but are not limited to, generative modeling, representation learning, robustness and reliability, probabilistic inference, and AI4science. I am one of the initial contributors to [score-based generative models](blog/2021/score) (diffusion models). My goal is to tackle fundamental problems that are broadly significant, devise methods that are simple yet effective, and build intelligent systems that can widely benefit humanity.

**Previously:** I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science from [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), advised by [Stefano Ermon](https://cs.stanford.edu/~ermon). I was a research intern at [Google Brain](https://research.google/teams/brain/), Uber ATG, and [Microsoft Research](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/lab/microsoft-research-cambridge/). I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and Physics from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/), where I worked with [Jun Zhu](http://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml), [Raquel Urtasun](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~urtasun/), and [Richard Zemel](http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~zemel/inquiry/home.php).

**Career Update:** I will be joining the Department of Electrical Engineering (EE) and Department of Computing + Mathematical Sciences (CMS) at California Institute of Technology as an Assistant Professor starting from January 2024. I am currently seeking self-motivated Ph.D. students and postdoctoral fellows to join my research group in Fall 2023. Candidates with backgrounds in CS, EE, physics, or statistics are especially encouraged to apply. If you are interested in working with me as a Ph.D. student, please apply to Caltech CMS/EE and mention my name in your applications. If you are interested in a postdoc position, please contact me directly.
